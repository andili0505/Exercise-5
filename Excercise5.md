# What is complex contagion and how it’s different from simple contagion?
Complex contagion is the phenomenon in social networks in which multiple sources of exposure to an innovation 
are required before an individual adopts the change of behavior. 
Simple contagion refers to spreading processes induced by a single exposure to a contagious entity 
while complex contagion demands multiple exposures for transmission. 
Simple contagions are good models for highly contagious diseases, or the spread of uncontroversial information.

Social contagion involves behavior, emotions, or conditions spreading spontaneously through a group or network. 
The critical difference of the complex contagion as compared to the simple contagion processes 
is that the probability of adoption depends on the number of exposures.

Centola and Macy explains four properties for multiple exposures in the spread of contagion:
Strategic complementarity:
Many innovations are costly, especially for early adopters but is becoming less costly for those who wait and adopt later. 
The same holds for participation in collective action. The first few who decide to conduct certain movement naturally face more uncertainties, risk and 
social cost. As more and more people join, those who join later are usually more confident and less worried for the outcomes.

Credibility:
Innovations often lack credibility until adopted by a threshold of the number of neighbors or a certain percentage. 
Hearing the same or at least similiar story from different groups of people makes it seem more crediable and more likely to be the truth.

Emotional contagion:
Most theoretical models of collective behavior – from action theory to threshold models to cybernetics
share the basic assumption that there are expressive and symbolic impulses in human behavior that can be communicated 
and amplified in spatially and socially concentrated gatherings.

# What does complex contagion mean for diffusion of behaviors in organization
Complex contagion is the phenomenon in social networks in which multiple sources of exposure to an innovation 
are required before an individual adopts the change of behavior.

Cascading behaviors in networks – diffusion over the entire network
When people are connected in networks to each other then they can influence each other's behavior and decisions. 

A typical example is the spread of rumors. The cascading behavior assumes that exposure to an idea will make sure that the exposed node will believe the idea. 
In Complex Contagion case, there’s no such guaranteed infection. 
The relative percentage of connected nodes to the node of interest and the individual susceptibility of each node 
will determine whether that node will be infected by the idea or not. 

Examples:
Adopting unproven or innovated technologies
Willingness to participate in the form of collective actions (protests)
Incentives to exit formal gatherings
Lifestyle trends: What clothing to wear, hairstyle to adopt, and what part of the body to pierce.[1]
The adoption of political hashtags on Twitter.
(Whether wearing masks is helpful when COVID first break out & Russia-Ukraine)

# How can we use the threshold models to better manage
(As adoption thresholds increase, connected ties between nodes can impede diffusion.)
## Prosocial behavior in organizations
This applies in both academic and corporate environment. One typical prosocial behaviors is the sense of colluboration. The goal of the manager or instructor 
is spreading this kind of collaboration vibe and mindset to the rest of the members. It's better to define a threshold, for example 20 percent of employees. Then when deciding proper grouping for teams, make sure the 20 percent of most active and collaborative employees to be distributed to an many groups as possible for them to spread. 

## Learning
When it comes to using threshold models to facilitate learning, it is similar to the case of adopting new technologies and methodologies.
When introducing a new methodology of tackling certain tasks, managers can use surveys to make sure that at least 30 percent (for example) of employees are in favor of this innovation. A certain threshold can be crucial the management team to decide whether to implement certain changes. And with a certain satisfactory and scientific threshold, ideas and innovations can have a higher probability to be successfully spreaded.

## Toxic or unproductive behaviors
In order to prevent the spreading of toxic or unproductive behaviors, manager can start to look into the connection between the persons with these behaviors and observe how the behaviors spread from one to others. Finding an effective way to elevate the threshold can decrease of probability of the spreading. It would be quite problematic if certain employees start to form their own connection network for the sake of their own interest which contradicts the benefit of the company (conflict of interest). I believe in most cases this would be the main cause of certain unproductive behaviors.
