# What is complex contagion and how it’s different from simple contagion?
Complex contagion is the phenomenon in social networks in which multiple sources of exposure to an innovation 
are required before an individual adopts the change of behavior. 
Simple contagion refers to spreading processes induced by a single exposure to a contagious entity 
while complex contagion demands multiple exposures for transmission. 
Simple contagions are good models for highly contagious diseases, or the spread of uncontroversial information.

Social contagion involves behavior, emotions, or conditions spreading spontaneously through a group or network. 
The critical difference of the complex contagion as compared to the simple contagion processes 
is that the probability of adoption depends on the number of exposures.


# What does complex contagion mean for diffusion of behaviors in organization
Complex contagion is the phenomenon in social networks in which multiple sources of exposure to an innovation 
are required before an individual adopts the change of behavior.

Centola and Macy explains four properties for multiple exposures in the spread of contagion:

Strategic complementarity:
Many innovations are costly, especially for early adopters but less so for those who wait. 
The same holds for participation in collective action.

Credibility:
Innovations often lack credibility until adopted by neighbors. 
Hearing the same story from different people makes it seem less likely that surprising 

information is nothing more than the fanciful invention of the informant.
Legitimacy:
Knowing that a movement exists or that a collective action will take place is rarely sufficient to induce bystanders to join in.
Having several close friends participate in an event often greatly increases an individual’s likelihood of also joining, 
especially for high-risk social movements. Innovators risk being shunned as deviants until there is a critical mass of early adopters, 
and non-adopters are likely to challenge the legitimacy of the innovation.

Emotional contagion:
Most theoretical models of collective behavior – from action theory to threshold models to cybernetics
share the basic assumption that there are expressive and symbolic impulses in human behavior that can be communicated 
and amplified in spatially and socially concentrated gatherings.

Cascading behaviors in networks – diffusion over the entire network
When people are connected in networks to each other then they can influence each other's behavior and decisions. 

Examples:
Adopting unproven or innovated technologies
Willingness to participate in the form of collective actions
Incentives to exit formal gatherings
Lifestyle trends: What clothing to wear, hairstyle to adopt, and what part of the body to pierce.[1]
The adoption of political hashtags on Twitter.
